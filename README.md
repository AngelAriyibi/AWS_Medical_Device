# AWS Medical Device 
In this project, I developed a cloud-based application leveraging AWS services to enhance healthcare through advanced medical imaging solutions. 
The application operates as follows:

1. Initially, it loads a dataset of medical images stored in an AWS S3 bucket, analogous to reading a parking record file.
2. It dynamically manages computational resources on AWS to process and analyze medical images, similar to tracking available parking spaces.
3. The application provides real-time updates on the processing status and accessibility of medical images, akin to displaying available parking spaces.
4. Users can query specific medical images or diagnostic information, reminiscent of querying parking tickets.
5. It utilizes AWS pricing models to efficiently manage computational costs, analogous to charging a parking fee.
